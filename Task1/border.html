&#8594China has denied having any Indian soldiers currently in custody, as both sides try to lower the temperature following a fatal clash along their disputed border in the Galwan Valley.<br><br>

&#8594Indian media had reported that China detained 10 Indian soldiers in the fight, releasing them on Thursday.<br><br>

&#8594Chinese government spokesman Zhao Lijian said on Friday that no Indian soldiers were "currently" being held.<br><br>

&#8594The Indian government said only that none of its soldiers were missing.<br><br>

&#8594The careful wording of the statements did little to clarify whether Chinese forces in the contested area had taken Indian soldiers into custody and subsequently released them.<br><br>

&#8594Indian media reports suggested that a lieutenant-colonel and three majors were among 10 held by the Chinese, and that their release was the top priority in military and diplomatic talks between the nuclear powers on Wednesday.<br><br>
